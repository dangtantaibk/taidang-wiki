## Introduction
Welcome to my comprehensive blog on "ChatGPT-4 Prompt Engineering for Developers." In this blog, I'm excited to take you through the complex and ever-evolving world of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially focusing on their application in software development and product innovation.

I am eager to introduce the concept of instruction-tuned LLMs. Unlike base LLMs that are trained to predict the next word in a sequence, instruction-tuned LLMs are crafted to follow specific instructions, making them more suited for practical applications. This distinction is vital for developers who aim to use LLMs for targeted and efficient outcomes in their software applications.

In this blog, I will explore a range of LLM use cases, including text summarization, inference, transformation, expansion, and even building chatbots using LLMs. My goal is to ignite your imagination and inspire you to create innovative applications quickly using LLM APIs.

I've designed this blog with insights from experts at OpenAI and DeepLearning.ai, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of these technologies. You'll learn about the best practices for using instruction-tuned LLMs, which are becoming the preferred choice for their enhanced safety, reliability, and user-intent alignment.

Prompt engineering, in this context, is both an art and a science. It requires clarity and specificity in your requests, similar to instructing a knowledgeable yet task-unaware individual. The effectiveness of LLM responses greatly depends on how precise your prompts are.

So, prepare to delve deep into the world of LLMs. I will provide you with the necessary skills and knowledge to fully leverage their potential. Whether you're a developer looking to integrate these models into your applications or an enthusiast eager to understand the future of AI in software development, this blog is tailored to satisfy both your professional and personal curiosity. Let's start this enlightening journey together!
## Guidelines
In this chapter, you'll practice two prompting principles and their related tactics in order to write effective prompts for large language models.

### Setup
Load the API key and relevant Python libaries.
``` python
import openai
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv())

openai.api_key  = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```
### helper function
Throughout this blog, we will use OpenAI's gpt-4-1106-preview model and [the chat completions endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/playground?mode=chat&model=gpt-4-1106-preview).

This helper function will make it easier to use prompts and look at the generated outputs.
``` python
def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]
```

**Note:** This and all other lab notebooks of this course use OpenAI library version `0.27.0`

In order to use the OpenAI library version `1.0.0`, here is the code that you would use instead for the `get_completion` function:

``` python 
client = openai.OpenAI()

def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```

### Prompting Principles
1. ***Principle 1: Write clear and specific instructions***
2. ***Principle 2: Give the model time to “think”*** 

### Principle 1: Write clear and specific instructions
**Tactic 1: Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input**
- Delimiters can be anything like: ```, """, < >, \<tag> \</tag>, :
``` python
text = f"""
You should express what you want a model to do by providing instructions that are as clear and specific as you can possibly make them. \ 
This will guide the model towards the desired output, and reduce the chances of receiving irrelevant or incorrect responses. Don't confuse writing a clear prompt with writing a short prompt. \ 
In many cases, longer prompts provide more clarity and context for the model, which can lead to more detailed and relevant outputs.
"""
prompt = f"""
Summarize the text delimited by triple backticks into a single sentence.
```{text}```
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

<details>
  To guide a model towards the desired output and reduce irrelevant or incorrect responses, it is important to provide clear and specific instructions, which can be achieved through longer prompts that offer more clarity and context.
</details>

**Tactic 2: Ask for a structured output**
- JSON, HTML
``` python
prompt = f"""
Generate a list of three made-up book titles along with their authors and genres. 
Provide them in JSON format with the following keys: 
book_id, title, author, genre.
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```
<details>
```
{
  "books": [
    {
      "book_id": 1,
      "title": "The Enigma of Elysium",
      "author": "Evelyn Sinclair",
      "genre": "Mystery"
    },
    {
      "book_id": 2,
      "title": "Whispers in the Wind",
      "author": "Nathaniel Blackwood",
      "genre": "Fantasy"
    },
    {
      "book_id": 3,
      "title": "Echoes of the Past",
      "author": "Amelia Hart",
      "genre": "Romance"
    }
  ]
}
```
</details>

**Tactic 3: Ask the model to check whether conditions are satisfied**
``` python
text_1 = f"""
Making a cup of tea is easy! First, you need to get some water boiling. While that's happening, grab a cup and put a tea bag in it. Once the water is hot enough, just pour it over the tea bag. \ 
Let it sit for a bit so the tea can steep. After a few minutes, take out the tea bag. If you like, you can add some sugar or milk to taste. \ 
And that's it! You've got yourself a delicious cup of tea to enjoy.
"""
prompt = f"""
You will be provided with text delimited by triple quotes. 
If it contains a sequence of instructions, re-write those instructions in the following format:

Step 1 - ...
Step 2 - …
…
Step N - …

If the text does not contain a sequence of instructions, then simply write \"No steps provided.\"

\"\"\"{text_1}\"\"\"
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print("Completion for Text 1:")
print(response)
```
<details>
- Completion for Text 1:
    - Step 1 - Get some water boiling.
    - Step 2 - Grab a cup and put a tea bag in it.
    - Step 3 - Once the water is hot enough, pour it over the tea bag.
    - Step 4 - Let it sit for a bit so the tea can steep.
    - Step 5 - After a few minutes, take out the tea bag.
    - Step 6 - If you like, add some sugar or milk to taste.
    - Step 7 - Enjoy your delicious cup of tea.
</details>
**Tactic 4: "Few-shot" prompting**
``` python 
prompt = f"""
Your task is to answer in a consistent style.

<child>: Teach me about patience.

<grandparent>: The river that carves the deepest valley flows from a modest spring; the grandest symphony originates from a single note; 
the most intricate tapestry begins with a solitary thread.

<child>: Teach me about resilience.
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```
<details>
- \<grandparent\>: Resilience is like a mighty oak tree that withstands the strongest storms, bending but never breaking. It is the ability to bounce back from adversity, to find strength in the face of challenges, and to persevere even when the odds seem insurmountable. Just as a diamond is formed under immense pressure, resilience is forged through the trials and tribulations of life.
</details>

Principle 2: Give the model time to “think”
**Tactic 1: Specify the steps required to complete a task**
``` python 
text = f"""
In a charming village, siblings Jack and Jill set out on \ 
a quest to fetch water from a hilltop \ 
well. As they climbed, singing joyfully, misfortune \ 
struck—Jack tripped on a stone and tumbled \

Though slightly battered, the pair returned home to \ 
comforting embraces. Despite the mishap, \ 
their adventurous spirits remained undimmed, and they \ 
continued exploring with delight.
"""
# example 1
prompt_1 = f"""
Perform the following actions: 
1 - Summarize the following text delimited by triple \
backticks with 1 sentence.
2 - Translate the summary into French.
3 - List each name in the French summary.

Output JSON: <json with summary and num_names>

Text: <{text}>
"""
response = get_completion(prompt_2)
print("\nCompletion for prompt 2:")
print(response)
```

**Tactic 2: Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion**

```python 
prompt = f"""
Determine if the student's solution is correct or not.

Question:
I'm building a solar power installation and I need \
 help working out the financials. 
- Land costs $100 / square foot
- I can buy solar panels for $250 / square foot
- I negotiated a contract for maintenance that will cost \ 
me a flat $100k per year, and an additional $10 / square \
foot
What is the total cost for the first year of operations 
as a function of the number of square feet.

Student's Solution:
Let x be the size of the installation in square feet.
Costs:
1. Land cost: 100x
2. Solar panel cost: 250x
3. Maintenance cost: 100,000 + 100x
Total cost: 100x + 250x + 100,000 + 100x = 450x + 100,000

<details>
- The student's solution is correct. They correctly identified the costs for land, solar panels, and maintenance, and calculated the total cost as a function of the number of square feet.
</details>
**Note:** that the student's solution is actually not correct. We can fix this by instructing the model to work out its own solution first.

```python 
prompt = f"""
Your task is to determine if the student's solution is correct or not.
To solve the problem do the following:
- First, work out your own solution to the problem including the final total. 
- Then compare your solution to the student's solution and evaluate if the student's solution is correct or not. 
Don't decide if the student's solution is correct until 
you have done the problem yourself.

Actual solution:
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```
<details>
To calculate the total cost for the first year of operations, we need to add up the costs of land, solar panels, and maintenance.

1. Land cost: $100 / square foot
The cost of land is $100 multiplied by the size of the installation in square feet.

2. Solar panel cost: $250 / square foot
The cost of solar panels is $250 multiplied by the size of the installation in square feet.

3. Maintenance cost: $100,000 + $10 / square foot
The maintenance cost is a flat fee of $100,000 per year, plus $10 multiplied by the size of the installation in square feet.

Total cost: Land cost + Solar panel cost + Maintenance cost

Let's calculate the total cost using the actual solution:

Total cost = (100 * x) + (250 * x) + (100,000 + (10 * x))
           = 100x + 250x + 100,000 + 10x
           = 360x + 100,000

Is the student's solution the same as the actual solution just calculated:
No

blender first then pulverize them in the serving size I want in the blender then switch to the whipping blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade \
first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade if I need them finer/less pulpy). Special tip when making smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and \
vegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the spinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making sorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor) \ 
that you plan to use that way you can avoid adding so much ice if at all-when making your smoothie. After about a year, the motor was making a funny noise. \

In a recent survey conducted by the government, public sector employees were asked to rate their level of satisfaction with the department they work at. 
The results revealed that NASA was the most popular department with a satisfaction rating of 95%.

One NASA employee, John Smith, commented on the findings, stating, "I'm not surprised that NASA came out on top. 
It's a great place to work with amazing people and incredible opportunities. I'm proud to be a part of such an innovative organization."

The results were also welcomed by NASA's management team, with Director Tom Johnson stating, "We are thrilled to hear that our employees are satisfied with their work at NASA. 
We have a talented and dedicated team who work tirelessly to achieve our goals, and it's fantastic to see that their hard work is paying off."

The survey also revealed that the Social Security Administration had the lowest satisfaction rating, with only 45% of employees indicating they were 
satisfied with their job. The government has pledged to address the concerns raised by employees in the survey and work towards improving job satisfaction across all departments.

## Transforming
Large Language Models excel in text transformation tasks, including language translation, spelling and grammar checking, tone adjustment, and format conversion.
``` python 
user_messages = [
  "La performance du système est plus lente que d'habitude.",  # System performance is slower than normal         
  "Mi monitor tiene píxeles que no se iluminan.",              # My monitor has pixels that are not lighting
  "Il mio mouse non funziona",                                 # My mouse is not working
  "Mój klawisz Ctrl jest zepsuty",                             # My keyboard has a broken control key
  "我的屏幕在闪烁"                                               # My screen is flashing

## Explanding
Large Language Models can generate personalized customer service emails tailored to each customer's review.
``` python 
# given the sentiment from the lesson on "inferring",
# and the original customer message, customize the email
sentiment = "negative"

# review for a blender
review = f"""
So, they still had the 17 piece system on seasonal sale for around $49 in the month of November, about half off, but for some reason (call it price gouging) \
around the second week of December the prices all went up to about anywhere from between $70-$89 for the same system. And the 11 piece system went up around $10 or \
so in price also from the earlier sale price of $29. So it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part where the blade locks into place doesn’t look as good \
as in previous editions from a few years ago, but I plan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush very hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the \ 
blender first then pulverize them in the serving size I want in the blender then switch to the whipping blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade \
first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade if I need them finer/less pulpy). Special tip when making smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and \
vegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the spinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making sorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor) \ 
that you plan to use that way you can avoid adding so much ice if at all-when making your smoothie. After about a year, the motor was making a funny noise. \
I called customer service but the warranty expired already, so I had to buy another one. FYI: The overall quality has gone done in these types of products, so \
they are kind of counting on brand recognition and consumer loyalty to maintain sales. Got it in about two days.

## Chatbot
One of the fascinating aspects of utilizing a large language model is the ability to create a customized chatbot effortlessly. ChatGPT's web interface offers a conversational platform enabled by a robust language model. However, the real excitement lies in harnessing the capabilities of a large language model to construct your chatbots, such as an AI customer service agent or an AI order taker for a restaurant.

In this case, we'll refer to the chatbot as "OrderBot." The aim is to automate collecting user prompts and assistant responses to construct this efficient "OrderBot." Primarily designed for taking orders at a pizza restaurant, the initial step involves defining a useful function. This function facilitates the collection of user messages, eliminating the need for manual input. The prompts gathered from a user interface created below are then appended to a list called "context." Subsequently, the model is invoked with this context for each interaction.

The model's response is incorporated into the context, ensuring that both the model's and the user's messages are retained, contributing to the growing context. This accumulation of information empowers the model to determine the appropriate actions to take.

Finally, the user interface is set up and executed to display the OrderBot. The context, which includes the system message containing the menu, remains consistent across each interaction with the language model. It steadily evolves as more interactions occur, maintaining a comprehensive conversation record.
``` python
def collect_messages(_):
    prompt = inp.value_input
    inp.value = ''
    context.append({'role':'user', 'content':f"{prompt}"})
    response = get_completion_from_messages(context) 
    context.append({'role':'assistant', 'content':f"{response}"})
    panels.append(
        pn.Row('User:', pn.pane.Markdown(prompt, width=600)))
    panels.append(
        pn.Row('Assistant:', pn.pane.Markdown(response, width=600, style={'background-color': '#F6F6F6'})))
 
    return pn.Column(*panels)
import panel as pn  # GUI
pn.extension()

panels = [] # collect display 

context = [ {'role':'system', 'content':"""
You are OrderBot, an automated service to collect orders for a pizza restaurant. \
You first greet the customer, then collects the order, \
and then asks if it's a pickup or delivery. \
You wait to collect the entire order, then summarize it and check for a final \
time if the customer wants to add anything else. \
If it's a delivery, you ask for an address. \
Finally you collect the payment.\
Make sure to clarify all options, extras and sizes to uniquely \
identify the item from the menu.\
You respond in a short, very conversational friendly style. \
