## Introduction

ChatGPT has rapidly become a global sensation. Its proficiency lies in offering broad-spectrum knowledge, but its understanding is rooted in pre-2021 publicly accessible internet information. It does not access personal data or incorporate the latest data sources.

Imagine the possibilities if it could!

This blog offers a step-by-step guide on customizing your own ChatGPT model to focus on a particular data set. Accompanied by a GitHub repository, this post provides essential code references. The primary focus is on text data handling. For insights on integrating natural language processing with other data sources, refer to the following tutorials:

- [SQL Database](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/toolkits/sql_database)
- [APIs](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains)

## High Level Overview

Essentially, there are two main elements in configuring ChatGPT for your specific dataset: (1) ingestion of the data, (2) chatbot over the data.
We'll delve into the key steps required for each component.

![overview-image](/static/images/customed_chatgpt/diagram.jpeg)

## Ingestion of data
Ingestion involves several steps. The steps are:

1. ***Load data sources to text:*** this involves loading your data from arbitrary sources to text in a form that it can be used downstream. 
2. ***Chunk text:*** this involves chunking the loaded text into smaller chunks. This is necessary because language models generally have a limit to the amount of text (tokens) they can deal with. "Chunk size" is something to be tuned over time.
3. ***Embed text:*** this involves creating a numerical embedding for each chunk of text. This is necessary because we only want to select the most relevant chunks of text for a given question, and we will do this by finding the most similar chunks in the embedding space.
4. ***Load embeddings to vectorstore:*** this involves putting embeddings and documents into a vectorstore. Vectorstores help us find the most similar chunks in the embedding space quickly and efficiently.

Langchain strives to be modular, so that each of these steps are straightforward to swap out with other components or approaches.

## Querying of Data
This can also be broken down into a few steps. The high level steps are:

1. ***Get input from the user:*** we'll use a web interface and a cli interface to receive input from the user about the documents.
2. ***Combine that input with chat history:*** we'll combine chat history and a new question into a single standalone question. This is often necessary because we want to allow for the ability to ask follow up questions (an important UX consideration).
3. ***Lookup relevant documents:*** using the vectorstore created during ingestion, we will look up relevant documents for the answer.
4. ***Generate a response:*** Given the standalone question and the relevant documents, we will use a language model to generate a response.

In this post, we'll explore some design decisions you have with history, prompts, and the chat experience. We won't touch on the deployment, but for more information see [deployment guide](https://python.langchain.com/docs/guides/deployments).

## Step by Step Details
This section dives into more detail on the steps necessary to ingest data.

![L1-Document_loading](/static/images/customed_chatgpt/L1-Document_loading.png)

See [Langchain documention (and over 120 data loaders) for more information about document loaders](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/). 

### Load data

First, we need to load data into a standard format. In langchain, a Document consists of (1) the text itself, 
(2) any metadata associated with that text (where it came from, etc). This is often critical for understanding and communicating the context for testing or for the end user.

- The line below contains the line of code responsible for loading the relevant documents.

``` python
print("Loading data...")
loader = UnstructuredFileLoader("state_of_the_union.txt")
raw_documents = loader.load()
```

- PDFs: Using the PyPDF loader to load PDFs, showcasing how each page of a PDF becomes a unique document.

```python
from langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader
loader = PyPDFLoader("docs/cs229_lectures/MachineLearning-Lecture01.pdf")
pages = loader.load()
page = pages[0]
print(page.page_content[0:500])
```

### Split Text

![L2-Document_splitting](/static/images/customed_chatgpt/L2-Document_splitting.png)

Splitting documents into smaller units of text for input into the model is critical for getting relevant information back from our chatbot. When documents are too big, you'll include irrelevant information to the model. Conversely, when they're too small, you'll not include enough information and the model may be confused about what is actually relevant.

The chunk size isn't quite a science, so you'll have to experiment to see if you can get good results.

``` python
print("Splitting text...")
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(
    separator="\n\n",
    chunk_size=600,
    chunk_overlap=100,
    length_function=len,
)
documents = text_splitter.split_documents(raw_documents)
```

- *Markdown Header Text Splitter:* This splitter is unique as it adds metadata from headers and subheaders to the chunks, enhancing the context and relevance of the data.
``` python
from langchain.document_loaders import NotionDirectoryLoader
from langchain.text_splitter import MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter

markdown_document = """# Title\n\n \
## Chapter 1\n\n \
Hi this is Jim\n\n Hi this is Joe\n\n \
### Section \n\n \
Hi this is Lance \n\n 
## Chapter 2\n\n \
Hi this is Molly"""

headers_to_split_on = [
    ("#", "Header 1"),
    ("##", "Header 2"),
    ("###", "Header 3"),
]

markdown_splitter = MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter(
    headers_to_split_on=headers_to_split_on
)
md_header_splits = markdown_splitter.split_text(markdown_document)

md_header_splits[0]
```

<details>
```Document(page_content='Hi this is Jim  \nHi this is Joe', metadata={'Header 1': 'Title', 'Header 2': 'Chapter 1'})```
</details>

### Create embeddings and store in vectorstore

![L3-Vectorstores_embeddings](/static/images/customed_chatgpt/L3-Vectorstores_embeddings.png)

Next, now that we have small chunks of text we need to create embeddings for each piece of text and store them in a vectorstore. We create embeddings because this is an efficient way of storing this text data and subsequently querying the store for documents relevant to our query.

Here we use OpenAI’s embeddings and a [FAISS vectorstore](https://faiss.ai/index.html) and store that as a python pickle file for later use.

``` python
print("Creating vectorstore...")
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(documents, embeddings)
with open("vectorstore.pkl", "wb") as f:
    pickle.dump(vectorstore, f)
```
Run this code to create the vectorstore. This is necessary after changing how you split the text or loading new documents. If you're making changes, adding documents, or splitting text different, you'll have to re-run things.

- Utilizing Vector Stores: For example, Chroma, a lightweight, in-memory vector store, is introduced. It's chosen for its ease of use and suitability for managing small datasets, although there are over 30 different vector stores integrated with LangChain for various needs.

``` python
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
persist_directory = 'docs/chroma/'

embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectordb = Chroma(
    persist_directory=persist_directory,
    embedding_function=embedding
)

texts = [
    """The Amanita phalloides has a large and imposing epigeous (aboveground) fruiting body (basidiocarp).""",
    """A mushroom with a large fruiting body is the Amanita phalloides. Some varieties are all-white.""",
    """A. phalloides, a.k.a Death Cap, is one of the most poisonous of all known mushrooms.""",
]

smalldb = Chroma.from_texts(texts, embedding=embedding)

question = "Tell me about all-white mushrooms with large fruiting bodies"

smalldb.similarity_search(question, k=2)
```

<details>
```
[Document(page_content='A mushroom with a large fruiting body is the Amanita phalloides. Some varieties are all-white.'),
 Document(page_content='The Amanita phalloides has a large and imposing epigeous (aboveground) fruiting body (basidiocarp).')]
```
</details>

## Query data

![L4-compression_llm](/static/images/customed_chatgpt/L4-compression_llm.png)

So now that we’ve ingested the data, we can now use it in a chatbot interface. 
In order to do this, we will use the [ConversationalRetrievalChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/).

There are several different options when it comes to querying the data. Do you allow follow up questions? Want to include other user context? There are lots of design decisions and below we'll discuss some of the most critical.

### Do you want to have conversation history?
This is table stakes from a UX perspective because it allows for follow up questions. Adding memory is simple, you can either use a built in module.

``` python 
llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4", temperature=0)
retriever = load_retriever()
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(
    memory_key="chat_history", return_messages=True)
# model = RetrievalQA.from_llm(llm=llm, retriever=retriever)
# if you don't want memory use the above, you will have to change
# the app.py or cli_app.py file to include `query` in the input instead of `question`
model = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
    llm=llm,
    retriever=retriever,
    memory=memory)
``` 

Alternatively, you can specify memory and pass it into the model, tracking it on your own. 
Run this example from the github repo with the following, then read the code in `query_data.py`.

``` python 
python cli_app.py

---------------
Your Question:  (what did the president say about ketanji brown?):
Answer: The President nominated Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve on the United States Supreme Court, describing her as one of the nation's top legal minds who will continue Justice Breyer's legacy of excellence. He also mentioned that she
is a former top litigator in private practice, a former federal public defender, and comes from a family of public school educators and police officers. He referred to her as a consensus builder and noted that since her nomination, she
has received a broad range of support from various groups, including the Fraternal Order of Police and former judges appointed by both Democrats and Republicans.
---------------
```

### Do you want to customize the QA prompt?
You can easily customize the QA prompt by passing in a prompt of your choice. This is similar in experience to most all chains in langchain.

``` python 
template = """You are an AI assistant for answering questions about the most recent state of the union address.
You are given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question. Provide a conversational answer.
If you don't know the answer, just say "Hmm, I'm not sure." Don't try to make up an answer.
If the question is not about the most recent state of the union, politely inform them that you are tuned to only answer questions about the most recent state of the union.
Lastly, answer the question as if you were a pirate from the south seas and are just coming back from a pirate expedition where you found a treasure chest full of gold doubloons.
Question: {question}
=========
{context}
=========
Answer in Markdown:"""

QA_PROMPT = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=[
                           "question", "context"])
llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4", temperature=0)
retriever = load_retriever()
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(
    memory_key="chat_history", return_messages=True)
model = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
    llm=llm,
    retriever=retriever,
    memory=memory,
    combine_docs_chain_kwargs={"prompt": QA_PROMPT})

```

Run this example from the github repo with the following, then read the code in `query_data.py`.

``` python 
python cli_app.py
Which QA model would you like to work with? [basic/with_sources/custom_prompt/condense_prompt] (basic): custom_prompt
Chat with your docs!
---------------
Your Question:  (what did the president say about ketanji brown?):
Answer: Arr matey, the cap'n, I mean the President, he did speak of Ketanji Brown Jackson, he did. He nominated her to the United States Supreme Court, he did, just 4 days before his address. He spoke highly of her, he did, callin' her
one of the nation's top legal minds. He believes she'll continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence, he does.

She's been a top litigator in private practice, a federal public defender, and comes from a family of public school educators and police officers. She's a consensus builder, she is. Since her nomination, she's received support from all
over, from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by both Democrats and Republicans. So, that's what the President had to say about Ketanji Brown Jackson, it is.
---------------
Your Question:  (what did the president say about ketanji brown?): who did she succeed?
Answer: Arr matey, ye be askin' about who Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson be succeedin'. From the words of the President himself, she be takin' over from Justice Breyer, continuin' his legacy of excellence on the United States Supreme
Court. Now, let's get back to countin' me gold doubloons, aye?
---------------

```
### Do you expect long conversations?

![L6-chat2](/static/images/customed_chatgpt/L6-chat2.png)

If so, you're going to want to condense previous questions and history in order to add context into the prompt. If you embed the whole chat history along with the new question to look up relevant documents, you may pull in documents no longer relevant to the conversation (if the new question is not related at all). Therefor, this step of condensing the chat history and a new question to a standalone question is very important.

``` python 
_template = """Given the following conversation and a follow up question, rephrase the follow up question to be a standalone question.
You can assume the question about the most recent state of the union address.

Chat History:
{chat_history}
Follow Up Input: {question}
Standalone question:"""
CONDENSE_QUESTION_PROMPT = PromptTemplate.from_template(_template)


llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4", temperature=0)
retriever = load_retriever()
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(
    memory_key="chat_history", return_messages=True)
# see: https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/issues/5890
model = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
    llm=llm,
    retriever=retriever,
    memory=memory,
    condense_question_prompt=CONDENSE_QUESTION_PROMPT,
    combine_docs_chain_kwargs={"prompt": QA_PROMPT}) # includes the custom prompt as well

```
Read the code in `query_data.py` for some example code to apply to your own projects.

### Do you want the model to cite sources?

![L5-techniques](/static/images/customed_chatgpt/L5-techniques.png)

Langchain can cite source documents in the model.
There's a lot you can do here, you can add your own metadata, your own sections, 
and other relevant information to return the most relevant metadata for your query.
``` python 
llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4", temperature=0)
retriever = load_retriever()
history = []
model = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
    llm=llm,
    retriever=retriever,
    return_source_documents=True)

def model_func(question):
    # bug: this doesn't work with the built-in memory
    # see: https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/issues/5630
    new_input = {"question": question['question'], "chat_history": history}
    result = model(new_input)
    history.append((question['question'], result['answer']))
    return result

model_func({"question":"some question you have"})
# this is the same interface as all the other models.
```

Run this example from the github repo with the following, then read the code in `query_data.py`.

## Language Model
The final lever to pull is what language model you use to power your chatbot. In my example i use the OpenAI LLM, but this can easily be substituted to other language models that LangChain supports, or you can even write your own wrapper.

## Putting it alll together
After making all the necessary customizations, and running `python ingest_data.py`, you can now interact with the chatbot.

I’ve exposed a really simple interface through which you can do. You can access this just by running `python cli_app.py` and this will open in the terminal a way to ask questions and get back answers. Try it out!
